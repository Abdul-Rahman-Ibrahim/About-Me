			  <h2>My name is Abdul-Rahman</h2>
			  <p>Hello and welcome! My name is Abdul-Rahman Ibrahim and I'm glad you're here.
				I'm a student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, with a keen interest in research and development. Currently, I am a research assistant at Koc University PAWs Lab, where we work on SCG sensors to gather signals from the chest, with the ultimate goal of improving healthcare and quality of life.
				As a first-generation student from Ghana, I am passionate about learning and growing, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I believe that education is a key tool for personal and societal development, and I am committed to making the most of my opportunities and giving back to my community.
				In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading about history and science, and spending time with my family and friends.	
				Thank you for taking the time to read about me, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
